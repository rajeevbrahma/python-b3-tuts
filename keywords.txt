Value           | True, False, None         | These has some value                              | 
Operator        | and,or                    | we can use to perform a logical operation         |
                |                           | and to check if a value is in a list, tuple,      |
                |                           | etc. and to check if two variables are the        |
                |                           | same object                                       |

                | not                       | we can use to reverse the result of a condition   |           
Control flow    | if, elif, else            | we can use to define a conditional statement      |
                |                           | conditional statements                            |
Iterative       | for,while                 | These are used for iterative statements like loops|

                |                           | current instance of the loop.                     |

                | pass                      | We can use it in empty control flow /             |
                |                           | empty functions / empty classes                   |
Functions       |  def                      | We can use it to define a function                |
